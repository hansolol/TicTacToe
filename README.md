# TicTacToe
## Description
This is a REACT Tic-tac-toe game. 
## How to Run
Download files, spin up a local server, open index.html.
## Roadmap of future improvements
The game is not able to be reset unless the page is refreshed. A Game Reset button will reset the board by setting player back to 1 and setting GameState to an empty array. Also, the game history can be kept by creating a component to display the list of previous games. This component can be added to the Game component.
